IF ON v1.0.9 DO NOT PRESS YES !!\nThe update will break greatly, instead PRESS NO, click on View Website, and use the download button there.\nThis is because I have introduced an installer program to make shortcuts and hopefully fix permission issues, overall it should help fix the problems of everyone."
